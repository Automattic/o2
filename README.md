The o2 Plugin for WordPress - blogging at the speed of thought

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Automattic/o2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Automattic/o2)

Dependencies
============

This plugin requires WordPress 4.2 or higher, and PHP 5.3.6 or higher (due to a specific XML-parsing feature in use).

This plugin works with the p2-breathe theme, available at
https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe

This plugin uses Genericons. If you're using [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/), then you should already have them available. If you're not using Jetpack, you should install and activate
the Genericon'd plugin, available at
https://wordpress.org/plugins/genericond/

This plugin's editor can insert code shortcodes.  To get
those to render as code blocks, you should install and activate
the SyntaxHighlighter Evolved plugin, available at
https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/
